          <p> My name is David Robert Coulombe. I am 32 years old and I am from a beautiful coastal town in Massachusetts. I studied at The University of Connecticut and earned a B.S. in Turf and Soil Sciences. I the came to North Carolina where my career took many interesting and fun turns and opened many doors to many opportunities that I never thought possible. I am now here, learning web development to yet again open another door to career success. </p>
